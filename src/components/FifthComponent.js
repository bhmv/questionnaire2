        Venue rental fees range from as little as $1000 to over $25000. The
        average venue rental fees run from $4000 to around $8000. Venue rental
        fees do not include the cost of catering and other wedding or event
        services. As a general guideline, your venue cost will make up somewhere
        between 15-30% of your total budget.
